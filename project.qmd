# A Project I’m Proud Of

This page highlights a project that represents how I think and work — breaking down problems, testing ideas quickly, and iterating.

## Project Title: Mini Data Tracker / Automation (Example)
**Goal:** Make repetitive tracking easier by automatically capturing structured information and saving it in a clean format.

### What I did
- Designed the data structure (fields and categories)
- Implemented a workflow that reduces manual input
- Tested edge cases (missing values, inconsistent inputs)

### What I learned
- Small automations save a lot of time when used daily
- Clean structure matters more than fancy features
- Testing for missing values early prevents messy output later

## Next improvements
- Add validation rules
- Add dashboard summaries
- Improve user experience (fewer clicks, clearer prompts)
