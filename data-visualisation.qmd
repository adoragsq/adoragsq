# Data Visualisation

This page presents a simple data visualisation created using **R and tidyverse**, based on concepts learnt in the introductory lessons.

## Dataset used

I used the built-in dataset `mtcars`, which contains numeric information about different car models.
Some of the variables include:

- `mpg`: miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)
- `wt`: weight of the car (in 1000 lbs)
- `cyl`: number of cylinders

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)

head(mtcars)
```

``` {r}
#| echo: true
cars <- mtcars |>
as_tibble() |>
select(mpg, wt, cyl)

cars

```

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(cars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
geom_point() +
labs(
title = "Fuel Efficiency vs Car Weight",
x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
y = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)"
)

```
