# Reflection on the use of GenAI

For this assessment, I used **GenAI (ChatGPT)** to support my workflow while still ensuring I understood and verified the final output.

## Why I chose this tool
- It helps me organise ideas quickly
- It explains syntax and errors clearly
- It speeds up drafting and formatting in Quarto

## How GenAI helped (with examples)
- **Quarto structure:** I used it to generate starter templates for pages (YAML + headings)
- **Debugging:** It helped me identify issues like unclosed code fences in code chunks
- **Polishing writing:** It improved the clarity and structure of my paragraphs and page flow

## What I found beneficial
- Faster iteration (I can try → fix → improve quickly)
- Clear explanations when I’m stuck
- Good for formatting and structuring content

## What was challenging
- I still need to verify suggestions (some solutions may not fit my exact setup)
- It’s easy to copy without thinking, so I made sure to test and understand each part

## How GenAI might help in my future studies/work
I think GenAI will be useful for:
- Drafting documentation
- Checking code logic and edge cases
- Improving productivity for routine tasks
- Learning new tools faster through guided examples
